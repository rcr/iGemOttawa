So I've added the innitial files for getting the project up and running.
Ignore the programmer art, we just need to fill that stuff in later by
replacing the assets with the proper things.



Issue:	the buttons I've attempted to add don't respond to events.
Apparently its because they're just bitmap images which isnt a subclass
of interactiveEvent, I'm really not sure how to import graphics for a button
I was hoping you would know.

Also if you see anything I've done that makes no sense please say so, 
I'm learning the language as I go so it's entirely possible that my code is shit.
