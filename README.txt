working on (*)

*   1. The in game title needs to be changed.
*   2. In the first introductory slide, the title of the game needs to be changed (its mentioned twice)
    3. In the fourth introductory slide, I mention terminators in the 7 categories of biobricks - 
       remove terminators from this list and cut down to 6 categories
    4. In level 3 - cut out the first two sentences of the first slide of the level description. 
       It discusses terminators.
    5. -galactosidase in level's 3 an 4 need to have the beta symbol inserted in front of it
    6. In level 5, the coding sequence galactosidase already on the plasmid needs to be called tetA 
       instead (Its mentioned in the description for the level)
*   7. In level 7, shouldn't the solution be LacO selected first and then LacI selected second? I can't 
       seem to pass this level. 
*   8. I think in levels 8-10 I might have mentioned terminators in some of the error messages and 
       maybe in the descriptions, could you omit any mention of terminators.
    
       As a general note, all mention of terminators should be eliminated from the game.

Level sequences are done. After level 10
it returns straight to the main menu, so 
maybe there needs to be some sort of "You
win!" type page?
